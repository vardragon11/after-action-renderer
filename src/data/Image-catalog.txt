To speed up video generation, cataloging images of interest is a smart move. You could organize them by categories like:

Environment types (urban, desert, forest, ocean)

Military units (infantry, armor, naval, air)

Equipment/weapons (rifles, tanks, jets)

Characters (soldiers, medics, commanders)

Objects/props (bunkers, vehicles, supply crates)

Time periods or factions (WWII, modern, sci-fi, NATO, etc.)

Include metadata like resolution, style (realistic, stylized), and source/usage rights. Want help setting up a structure or tool for managing the catalog?
You can manage it using a spreadsheet, a lightweight database (like SQLite), or a tool like Notion or Airtable depending on your needs. Here’s a basic schema:

Image Catalog Structure
Field				Description
Image ID			Unique identifier (e.g., IMG001)
Filename			Image file name
Category			Environment, Unit, Equipment, Character, Object
Subcategory			More detail (e.g., Desert, Infantry, Tank, Commander)
Faction/Time 		Period	NATO, USSR, WWII, Sci-fi, etc.
Style				Realistic, Stylized, Cartoon, etc.
Resolution			1920x1080, 4K, etc.
Source				Where the image came from (e.g., Midjourney, DALL·E, Stock)
Usage Rights		Public domain, licensed, AI-generated, etc.
Tags				Freeform keywords to aid search (e.g., “night ops”, “urban ruins”)
Preview URL/Path	Link or path to view the image
Notes				Optional comments (e.g., “Good for intro scenes”)
